# Cascading Style Sheets: CSS
- a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML, including SVG, MathML, or XHTML
- describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media
- crucial for creating visually appealing, user-friendly, and maintainable websites, as it separates the presentation of a document from its content and structure

### Basic CSS concepts 
**Understanding these core concepts provides a strong foundation for writing effective and maintainable CSS**
- Syntax
- Cascading
- Inheritance
    - Some CSS properties, like color and font-family, are inherited by child elements from their parent elements. This means you can set a style once on a parent element, and its children will automatically adopt that style unless explicitly overridden.
- [Selectors](./Selectors.md)
    - used to select the HTML elements you want to style
- [The Box Model](./BoxModel.md)
    - every HTML element is treated as a rectangular box and the box model describes the layout of these boxes
