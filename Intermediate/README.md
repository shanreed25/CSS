# Intermediate CSS

Intermediate CSS concepts build upon fundamental knowledge of selectors, properties, and the box model to enable more complex layouts, responsive design, and dynamic visual effects

- [Colors]()
- [Specificity and Inheritance]()
    - A deeper understanding of how the browser determines which CSS rules apply when there are conflicting declarations, and how properties are inherited from parent elements to their children.
- [Box Model]()
- [Flexbox]()
    - a one-dimensional layout module that provides an efficient way to arrange and distribute space among items within a container, making it ideal for creating flexible and responsive navigation bars, content sections, and other components
- [CSS Grid]()
    - a two-dimensional layout system that allows for the creation of complex grid-based layouts with precise control over rows and columns, offering a powerful alternative or complement to Flexbox for overall page structure
- [Responsive Design and Media Queries]()
    - techniques like relative sizing units (e.g., em, rem, vw, vh) and @media rules are used to create layouts that adapt to various screen sizes and devices, ensuring optimal viewing experiences on desktops, tablets, and mobile phones

- [Advanced Selectors]()
    - intermediate CSS utilizes pseudo-classes (e.g., :hover, :focus, :nth-child()) and pseudo-elements (e.g., ::before, ::after) to target specific states or parts of elements for styling. Attribute selectors and combinators (e.g., +, ~, >) also fall into this category
- [Positioning]()
    - Understanding position properties (static, relative, absolute, fixed, sticky) and their interaction with top, right, bottom, and left properties is crucial for precise element placement and creating overlays or fixed headers/footers.
- [Transitions and Animations]()
    - CSS transitions enable smooth changes in property values over a specified duration, while animations provide more complex, multi-step visual effects using @keyframes rules.
- [CSS Variables (Custom Properties)]()
    - Defining custom properties allows for the reuse of values throughout a stylesheet, improving maintainability and making it easier to manage themes, colors, and other design elements.

- [Preprocessors]()
    - While not strictly CSS, preprocessors introduce features like variables, nesting, mixins, and functions that significantly enhance CSS development workflow and organization.
