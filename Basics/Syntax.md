# CSS Syntax
- CSS rules consist of a selector and a declaration block
- the selector targets HTML elements
- the declaration block contains one or more declarations
- each declaration is a property-value pair, specifying a style to apply `color: purple;`

    ```
        h1 { /* Selector */
        color: purple; /* Declaration: property-value pair */
        font-size: 12px; /* a second declaration */
        }
    ```
