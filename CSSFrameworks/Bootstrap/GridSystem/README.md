# Fundamental Layout Components
**The fundamental layout components in Bootstrap are primarily built upon its Grid System and Containers. These elements work together to create responsive and organized page layouts**

# Grid System
- a responsive, mobile-first grid built with Flexbox
- allows for the creation of responsive layouts by dividing the page into a 12-column grid
- scales up to 12 columns as the device or viewport size increases
- utilizes containers to wrap content, rows to group columns, and columns (with classes like col-md-6) to define content width and responsiveness across different screen sizes (xs, sm, md, lg, xl).

### Key Components
- **[Containers](./Containers.md)** are the outermost wrappers for your content
- **[Rows](./RowsandColumns.md#rows-rows)** are horizontal groups that wrap columns
- **[Columns](./RowsandColumns.md#columns-col)** are the direct children of rows and hold your actual content
