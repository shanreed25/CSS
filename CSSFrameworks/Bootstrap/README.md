# [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- a free and open-source front-end framework
- designed to simplify and accelerate the development of responsive, mobile-first websites
- can override default styles with custom CSS, utilize Sass variables for easier theme adjustments, or download customized builds from the official website
# Key Features
- **Responsive Design**
    - core feature is its responsive, mobile-first grid system, which allows websites to automatically adjust their layout and appearance to fit various screen sizes
    - styles are designed for smaller screens first and then scaled up for larger devices using media queries. This ensures websites adapt seamlessly to various screen sizes and orientations.
- **Pre-designed Components**
    - provides a collection of pre-styled HTML and CSS components, such as navigation bars, buttons, forms, carousels, modals, and more
    - saves developers time by eliminating the need to code these common elements from scratch.
- **CSS Framework**
    - is primarily a CSS framework that utilizes predefined classes to apply styles and layouts to HTML elements
    - promotes consistency and reduces the amount of custom CSS required.
- **JavaScript Plugins**
    - includes optional JavaScript plugins for interactive features like dropdowns, accordions, and popovers, further enhancing user experience
- **Faster Development**
    - offers pre-built components and a streamlined workflow
    - allow developers to significantly speeds up the web development process, allowing developers to focus more on content and functionality
- **Consistency**
    - helps maintain design consistency across a project, especially when multiple developers are working on it, by providing a standardized set of styles and components
